DEFINITION:

XNOR gate takes only two inputs and produces one output.
The output of the XNOR gate is high or logic 1 only when it has similar inputs.
The operation of XNOR gate can be described through a mathematical equation called the boolean expression of XNOR gate.
Here is the boolean expression of the XNOR gate.
