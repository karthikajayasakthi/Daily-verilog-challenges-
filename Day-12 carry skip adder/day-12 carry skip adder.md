DEFINITION :

A Carry Skip Adder (CSKA) is a type of digital adder designed to improve the speed of binary addition by reducing the carry propagation delay.
It achieves this by allowing the carry to "skip" over certain groups (blocks) of bits when a propagate condition is met, thereby accelerating
the addition process.

EXPRESSION :

sum = p ^ cin

Carry=c1 = g | (p & cin)

p = a ^ b

g= a & b;
