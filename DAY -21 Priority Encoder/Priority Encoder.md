PRIORITY ENCODER :

DEFINITION 

In digital electronics, a priority encoder is a combinational logic circuit that encodes the active input with the highest 
priority into a binary code. 
The encoder outputs a binary code that corresponds to the highest-priority active input.
It also typically provides an output to indicate if any input is active (usually called the "valid" or "enable" output).
