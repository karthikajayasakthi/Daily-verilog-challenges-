DEFINITION :

A Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) is a type of digital adder designed to improve speed by reducing the time required to calculate carry bits.
Unlike the Ripple Carry Adder, which propagates carry bits sequentially through each bit position,a CLA calculates the carry bits in 
parallel, allowing for faster addition.

Generate (G): This occurs when both bits in the addition are 1, meaning the position will generate a carry regardless of the previous 
carry.

g = a & b

Propagate (P): This occurs when either bit in the addition is 1, meaning the position will propagate the carry from the previous bit.

p = a ^ b

EXPRESSION :

carry=g0+p0.cin

sum=p0^cin

g=a&b

p=a^b
