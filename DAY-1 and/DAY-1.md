Define AND Gate
AND gate is the fundamental logic gate that executes the logical multiplication of binary input. The AND operation is carried out in the same
way as standard multiplications of 1s and 0s. An AND gate is a logic circuit that performs AND operations on the input of the circuit. When all
the inputs are 1, the AND Gate outputs 1,otherwise it outputs 0. A dot (.) denotes the AND operation.
