DEFINITION :


A carry-increment adder is a type of adder used in digital circuits for performing binary addition. It works by breaking down the addition process into smaller
sections to improve speed and efficiency.
The advantage of a carry-increment adder is that it speeds up the process of binary addition by reducing the carry propagation delay. Itâ€™s often used in high-speed 
arithmetic units of processors and hardware systems where quick binary addition is needed
