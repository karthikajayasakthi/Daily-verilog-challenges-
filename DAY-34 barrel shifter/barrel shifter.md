BARREL SHIFTER

Barrel shifter is a combinational circuit, unlike regular shifters which are sequential circuit.  To shift a 8 bit data , register based 
shifters will take 8 clock cycles whereas Barrel Shifter can do it by the time of one clock cycleIt is used in ALU for performing shifting 
operation.
